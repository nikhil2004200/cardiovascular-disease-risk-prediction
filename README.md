# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease using lifestyle, demographic, and medical survey data. The goal is to identify key risk factors and apply machine learning models to support early detection and preventive healthcare decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze lifestyle and medical factors affecting cardiovascular health  
- To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- To build and evaluate machine learning models for risk prediction  
- To identify the most important features contributing to heart disease  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Data collected through a Google Form survey  
- Self-reported lifestyle, demographic, and medical information  
- File used: `cvd.xlsx - Form Responses 1.csv`

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data collection and understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection and encoding  
5. Model training and testing  
6. Performance evaluation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The Random Forest model performed better and was selected as the final model due to higher accuracy and better handling of feature importance.
